## Let's meet
Let's meet was done as a task for summer internship in Orange company.

## Aim
In this task with 2 calendar files i had to combine them and find free range times when there is opportunity to meet with specified meeting time duration.

## Technologies
Java, Maven.

## Launch
After launch programme we can display free range times and change meeting time duration.

## How i did that?
After converted txt files into json and then into Calendar objects i decided to find free range meeting times for each calendar and then combine them into one. For that i divided
range times in 5 min for example [12:00-12:05] [12:05-12:10] [13:30-13:35] with that i combined 2 calendars with same range time and then depending on specifed meeting time duration i found full range times.
